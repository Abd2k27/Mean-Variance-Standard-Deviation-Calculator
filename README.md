# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

""The task is to create a function called calculate() in mean_var_std.py that accepts a list of 9 digits as input. The function should convert the list into a 3x3 NumPy array and return a dictionary that contains the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.""
